# VRCFaceTracking Privacy Policy

At VRCFaceTracking, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide when using our VRCFaceTracking application.

## Information Collection and Use
We do not actively collect or store any personal user data within our application. However, we use a third-party error tracking service called Sentry to help diagnose and fix issues that may arise.

### Sentry Data Collection
Sentry automatically collects and transmits certain data to its servers for error diagnosis and basic usage analytics purposes. The types of data that may be collected and sent to Sentry include:

- **Error Data**: Details about errors or exceptions that occur in the application, such as stack traces, error messages, and environment information.
- **Application Data**: Information about the application itself, such as the version, environment variables, and other metadata.
- **Network Data**: In rare cases, when a DNS parsing error occurs, the packet that caused the error may be sent to Sentry for diagnosis. This packet may contain data about your local network, such as device names, but no sensitive data beyond that.
- **Avatar Parameter Data**: In some cases, when a parsing error related to avatar parameters occurs, data about the avatar parameters may be sent to Sentry for diagnosis purposes.

Sentry does not collect any personal or identifiable user data from our application. However, please review Sentry's [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/) for more information on how they handle the data they receive.

**Note**: The collection of network and avatar parameter data is a temporary measure to help diagnose and resolve early issues with our application. As these issues are addressed, we plan to update this privacy policy to remove the collection of such data.

## Data Use
Any data collected by Sentry is used solely for the purpose of error diagnosis, fixing bugs, and improving the performance and stability of our VRCFaceTracking application. We do not share or sell this data with any third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

## Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the data collected by Sentry from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
